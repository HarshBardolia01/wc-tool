## Description

This challenge is to build out own version of the Unix command line tool wc! We need to take the input from a file passed in arguments or stdin, and print the number of bytes, words, lines and charcters according to the flag present.

| Flag | Info                                         |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------- |
| -c   | Outputs the number of bytes in the file      |
| -l   | Outputs the number of lines in the file      |
| -w   | Outputs the number of words in the file      |
| -m   | Outputs the number of characters in the file |



## Usage

Execute `go build -o ccwc` to create the executable. Now run the executable `ccwc` with the required flag and file name. Following are the possible arguments.



Basic Command will be of type

```shell
./ccwc <flag> <fileName>
```

or

```sh
cat <fileName> | ./ccwc <flag>
```



## Examples

#### From File

| Output Requirment      | Command              |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| Bytes                  | `./ccwc -c test.txt` |
| Lines                  | `./ccwc -l test.txt` |
| Words                  | `./ccwc -w test.txt` |
| Characters             | `./ccwc -m test.txt` |
| Lines, Words and Bytes | `./ccwc test.txt`    |

#### From Stdin

| Output Requirment      | Command                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Bytes                  | `cat test.txt |./ccwc -c` |
| Lines                  | `cat test.txt |./ccwc -l` |
| Words                  | `cat test.txt |./ccwc -w` |
| Characters             | `cat test.txt |./ccwc -m` |
| Lines, Words and Bytes | `cat test.txt |./ccwc`    |



## Learnings

- It was a nice opportunity for me to learn about the `flag` package of Go, which helped me read the flag and file name from the command line.
- Implemented Modules for `Arguments` and `Calculations`, which added a practice for me to work with custom modules, exporting Types and Functions in GoLang.
- Utilized `os` and `io` packages to read the file and stdin respectively.
- Calculating the Bytes, Lines, Words and Charcters in Go was a bit challenging part, which needed a bit of lookup on how the `bufio` package works. (Although I didn't use it eventually for the solution)
- Got to know more about `Runes` and `Fields` in GoLang.
